  "auto-file-renaming" : "Rename  file  name if the same file already exists.  This option works only in HTTP(S)/FTP download.  The new file name has a dot and a num‐ ber(1..9999) appended.  Default: true",
  "auto-save-interval" : "Save a control file(*.aria2) every SEC seconds.  If 0 is given, a control file is not saved during download. aria2 saves a control file when it stops regardless of the value. The possible values are between 0 to 600.  Default: 60",
  "conditional-get" : "Download file only when the local file is older than remote file. This function only works with HTTP(S) downloads only.  It does not work if file size is specified in Metalink. It also ignores Content-Disposition header.  If a control file exists,  thisoptionwill  be  ignored. This function uses If-Modified-Since header to get only newer file conditionally. When getting modification time of local file, it uses user supplied filename(see --out option) or filename part in URI if --out is not specified.  To overwrite  existing  file,  --allow-overwriteis required. Default: false",
  "conf-path" : "Change the configuration file path to PATH.  Default: $HOME/.aria2/aria2.conf",

  "deferred-input" : "If true is given, aria2 does not read all URIs and options from file specified by --input-file option at startup, but it reads  one  by  one when it needs later. This may reduce memory usage if input file contains a lot of URIs to download.  If false is given, aria2 reads all URIs and options at startup.  Default: false",
  "disk-cache" : "Enable disk cache. If SIZE is 0, the disk cache is disabled. This feature caches the downloaded data in memory, which grows to at most  SIZE bytes.  The  cache storage is created for aria2 instance and shared by all downloads. The one advantage of the disk cache is reduce the disk I/O because the data are written in larger unit and it is reordered by the offset of the file.  If hash checking is involved  and the  data are cached in memory, we don't need to read them from the disk.  SIZE can include K or M (1K = 1024, 1M = 1024K). Default: 0",

  "event-poll" : "Specify the method for polling events.  The possible values are epoll, kqueue, port, poll and select.  For  eachepoll,kqueue, port  and poll,  it is available if system supports it.  epoll is available on recent Linux. kqueue is available on various *BSD systems including Mac OS X. port is available on Open Solaris. The default value may vary depending on the system you use.",
  "file-allocation" : "Specify file allocation method.  none doesn't pre-allocate file space. prealloc pre-allocates file space before downloadbegins. This  may take  some  timedepending on the size of the file.  If you are using newer file systems such as ext4 (with extents support), btrfs, xfs or NTFS(MinGW build only), falloc is your best choice. It allocates large(few GiB) files almost instantly. Don't use fallocwith  legacy  file systems  such as ext3 and FAT32 because it takes almost same time as prealloc and it blocks aria2 entirely until allocation finishes. falloc may not be available if your system doesn't have posix_fallocate(3) function.  trunc uses ftruncate(2)  system  call  or platform-specific counterpart to truncate a file to a specified length.  Possible Values: none, prealloc, trunc, falloc Default: prealloc",
  "force-save" : "Save  download  with --save-session option even if the download is completed or removed. This may be useful to save BitTorrent seeding which is recognized as completed state. Default: false",

The GID must be hex string of 16  characters,  thus  [0-9a-zA-Z]  are allowed  and  leading zeros must not be stripped. The GID all 0 is reserved and must not be used. The GID must be unique, otherwise error is reported and the download is not added.  This option is useful when restoring the sessions saved using --save-session option. If this option is not used, new GID is generated by aria2.",

  "interface" : "Bind sockets to given interface. You can specify interface name, IP address and hostname. Possible Values: interface, IP address, hostname Note: If  an interface has multiple addresses, it is highly recommended to specify IP address explicitly. See also --disable-ipv6.  If your system doesn't have getifaddrs(3), this option doesn't accept interface name.",
  "max-download-result" : "Set maximum number of download result kept in memory. The download results are completed/error/removed downloads. The download  results  are stored  in  FIFO queue and it can store at most NUM download results. When queue is full and new download result is created, oldest download result is removed from the front of the queue and new one is pushed to the back. Setting big number in this option may  result  high  memory consumption after thousands of downloads. Specifying 0 means no download result is kept. Default: 1000",
  "max-resume-failure-tries" : "When used with --always-resume=false, aria2 downloads file from scratch when aria2 detects N number of URIs that does not support resume. If N is 0, aria2 downloads file from scratch when all given URIs do not support resume.  See --always-resume option. Default: 0",
